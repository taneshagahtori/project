  --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;
  --secondary: 210 40% 96.1%;
  --accent: 210 40% 96.1%;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Component Styling
All components use consistent styling patterns:
- Tailwind utility classes for rapid development
- Custom CSS components for complex layouts
- Responsive breakpoints for all screen sizes

## 📊 Performance Considerations
